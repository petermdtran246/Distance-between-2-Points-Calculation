# Distance between 2 Points Calculation
This C++ program calculates the distance between two points in a two-dimensional plane using the given parameters: the coordinates of the first point (𝑥1,𝑦1) and the coordinates of the second point (𝑥2,𝑦2).

## Expression Used for Calculation
The program uses the following expression to calculate the distance between two points:

dist = sqrt(pow(x2-x1, 2) + (pow(y2-y1,2)))

## Parameters
  -  (x1,y1): Coordinates of the first point.
  -  (x2,y2): Coordinates of the second point.
